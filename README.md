# Fullstack React Blog Project-------

## Description:
 This app build with the existing knowledge of the React basics, and give you further practice working with codebase linting, component testing, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript. 
 A user should, at the bare minimum, be able to view all posts, add a post, and delete a post. Consider adding the ability to update existing posts, add and set categories on blog posts, specify users, etc.
 
This app used Redux Toolkit and state slices to manage any state data needed across multiple components. In the case where data is created and used only within one component (or possibly one and a few of its direct children), consider using useState() or useReducer() and traditional prop drilling. Most apps will use a combination of "local" state management (useState() and useReducer()) and "global" state management (Redux or Context API).

Apply the TypeScript static typing system. try to use TypeScript for the majority of  React components!  installed typescript, add support for TypeScript linting, and use either .ts or .tsx extension for the files to apply TypeScript type-checking on.
